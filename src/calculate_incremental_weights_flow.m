function lv = calculate_incremental_weights_flow(model, y, xp, x, theta, lqx)
% # Incremental weights for Gaussian particle flow OID approximation
% ## Usage
% * `lv = calculate_incremental_weights_flow(model, y, xp, x, theta, q)`
%
% ## Description
% Calculates the incremental particle weights when using the Gaussian
% particle flow OID approximation [1].
%
% ## Input
% * `model`: State-space model struct.
% * `y`: dy-times-1 measurement vector y[n].
% * `xp`: dx-times-J matrix of newly drawn particles for the state x[n].
% * `x`: dx-times-J matrix of previous state particles x[n-1].
% * `theta`: Additional parameters.
% * `q`: Importance density struct.
%
% ## Output
% * `lv`: Logarithm of incremental weights.

% TODO:
% * This is a dummy function right now, and we should properly integrate it
%   into the calculate_incremental_weigths_generic function (see remarks in
%   pf). It might also require rewriting the flow weight calculation
%   slightly (in sample_gaussian_flow()).
